## Project 2

### Folder Descriptions:
- **Dump**: Contains all the images included in the website.
- **hybrid_python**: This folder has the starter code for generating hybrid images as well as my customized code for the same.
- **Data**: This folder has additional images that I've used in the code.
- **hybrid_python/images**: Contains additional images that were specifically used for generating hybrid images.

### File Descriptions:
- **index.html**: This file displays the entirety of my project work.
- **main.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that walks through most parts of the project. Each section is clearly labeled within the notebook.
- **hybrid_python/FFhybridImageGenerator.py**: This script is responsible for generating the hybrid images after they're properly aligned.
- **hybrid_python/FFfourierTransform.py**: This script fulfills the Fourier transform requirements for the project.
